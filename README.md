# atompy

This now abandoned package was developed to produce the master equation of an atomic system in symbolic form. Development on the project stopped once it was realized that the computational complexity of producing such an equation was exponential, and could only produce meaningful results for extremely simple atomic systems. The master equation for more complex and realistic atomic systems could take upwards of an hour to produce, and would still require numerical solving -- rendering the symbolic nature of the resulting master equation pointless.
